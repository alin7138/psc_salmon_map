And it was that traditional chief and his wing chiefs that managed those fisheries and would decide when, you know, they felt enough fish were in the spawning areas so they could go and start harvesting. So it just really demonstrates the long history of sustainable management even before European contact." <br><i> - Mark Cleveland, Fisheries Biologist for the Gitanyow First Nations'
